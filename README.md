# KarmaBook

Karmabook is the Android App I worked on my first Intern. It is used for Data Collection online or offline by filling Survey forms. This was coded as part of a hackathon. It had to be made within 5 days.

## Features

1. Users can Register/Login as either Surveyor or Surveyee.
2. Surveyor can create forms which can be filled by Surveyee for various purposes.
3. Forms contains features such as text/image data, Signature taking functionality, GPS Location Recording, etc.
4. Forms can be downloaded/saved on android Local Storage.
5. Change Profile details, add Avatar, etc.
6. Data Visualisation of No of Responses on various forms vs Time.
7. Dynamic creation of forms by parsing JSON Data.
